@515hikaru configuration for Emacs.

* Python Environment

- I use [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] with [[https://github.com/ambv/black][black]] formatter.
- I manage virtual environments with [[https://github.com/necaris/conda.el][conda.el]].

#+BEGIN_SRC
pip install 'python-language-server[all]'
pip install pyls-black
#+END_SRC

Before starting development, I have to create virtual environment by =conda= and activate on Emacs(=M-x conda-env-activate=)
